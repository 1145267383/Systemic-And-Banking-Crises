One of the most interesting data science projects I worked on was the analysis of systemic and banking crises, which is documented in the project "Systemic And Banking Crises" on GitHub. The project involved several key stages, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of banking crises across different countries and time periods.

The project began with **data collection** from a variety of reliable sources, which are consolidated in the [00-Database](https://github.com/1145267383/Systemic-And-Banking-Crises/tree/master/00-Database) directory. This phase required meticulous attention to detail to ensure that the data was both accurate and relevant for the subsequent analysis. I played a crucial role in gathering and organizing this data, which included historical financial indicators, macroeconomic variables, and institutional factors.

Next, the project moved into **data cleaning and merging**, detailed in the [01-Cleaning](https://github.com/1145267383/Systemic-And-Banking-Crises/tree/master/01-Cleaning) phase. Here, I encountered significant challenges, particularly with missing data and inconsistencies across different datasets. My contributions included developing strategies for data imputation, standardizing formats, and ensuring that the merged dataset was ready for analysis.

During the **exploratory analysis** phase, which is captured in the [02-Analysis](https://github.com/1145267383/Systemic-And-Banking-Crises/tree/master/02-Analysis) directory, I conducted in-depth analyses to identify trends, correlations, and potential predictors of banking crises. This step laid the foundation for more advanced analyses.

The **statistical analysis** was carried out in [Testing.ipynb](https://github.com/1145267383/Systemic-And-Banking-Crises/blob/master/02-Analysis/Testing.ipynb), where hypothesis testing and regression models were employed to validate our initial findings. I was instrumental in applying these methods to draw significant conclusions from the data.

Following this, I implemented **machine learning models** as detailed in the [03-Machine](https://github.com/1145267383/Systemic-And-Banking-Crises/tree/master/03-Machine) directory, aiming to predict the likelihood of future banking crises. My work involved selecting the appropriate algorithms, fine-tuning models, and interpreting the results to provide actionable insights.

Finally, the results were made accessible through a **website** ([04-Web](https://github.com/1145267383/Systemic-And-Banking-Crises/tree/master/04-Web)), which I helped design to ensure that stakeholders could interact with the data and findings effectively. The project culminated in a set of **recommendations**, outlined in the [readme.md](https://github.com/1145267383/Systemic-And-Banking-Crises/blob/master/readme.md), providing valuable guidance for policymakers to mitigate the risk of banking crises.

This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also demonstrated the impact of data science in addressing real-world financial challenges.
