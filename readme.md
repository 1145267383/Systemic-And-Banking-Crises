>- the occurrence of `Banking Crisis` Cause in a `Systemic Crisis`, at a rate of `62%`.
>- In contrast, that the occurrence of `Systemic Crisis` It was because a `Banking Crisis`, at a rate of `91%`.
>- The occurrence rate  of `Banking Crisis` are higher than `Systemic Crisis` by `47%`.

#### (2)
>-  That a {Gold Standard, Exch USD, GDP Weighted Default } `has no clear affect` on  banking crisis and systemic crisis.
>- That each from {Domestic Debt In Default, Sovereign External Debt 1, Sovereign External Debt 2,  Independence,  Currency Crises, Inflation Crises, Inflation} `has affect` on banking crisis and systemic crisis by `positive`.

#### (3)
>- Exch {`USD` by `GBP`} affect in Exch {`EGP` by `USD`}.
>>- That is, the `high` the value of the `USD`, the `low` the value of the `EGP`.
